Hello. I did the a review last month for Wargroove and since then I've gotten my hands on The Caligula Effect: Overdose. Maybe it will influence your purchase decision. This is a JRPG with heavy influence from the persona 1/2 series (they have the same guys working on it).

It is a story-heavy turn-based jrpg with dungeon.

Hi I am currently looking for basic 3D models/meshes of anime chracters for use for 3Ds max 5. All I am after is just basic models (the body and the head) so that I can then work on it myself. After my 3DS died I started playing the Let’s Go competitive scene. First, the competitive battling in Let’s Go is more of a brain dead experience compared to the mainline game. With that said I have a unanswerable question and observations. What’s the deal Korean and Japanese players having Mewtwo and Mew on their teams? The majority of the Asian players I’ve encountered all have those two on their teams. It feels extremely cheap. I’m not salty about it though because while. New to 3ds max!.

Motivated by curiosity, some interesting coverage by GameXplain, and a fondness for Roy in Smash Bros, I decided to randomly pick it up one day towards the end of March 2016. I was in love. I have always enjoyed games that forced you to think and strategize and that game just really scratched that itch for me. I quickly played through Birthright twice.
