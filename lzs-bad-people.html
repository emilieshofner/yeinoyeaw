But sometimes, there are people we encounter who are so bad at their job that we have to wonder exactly how they were able to find employment in the first place. Imagine abandoning your wife and kids for some 16 year old you met at a tournament, getting her family massacred, getting your family massacred and raped after your death, and causing a giant civil war but deciding to hide with your teenage side chick for the 1st year of it. A lot of people believe that Lyanna left of her own free will but that makes her just as bad.

Alright I’m gonna get a lot of accusations and hate but I’m posting this anyway. There is a difference between a pedophile and a child molester. A pedophile is only a bad person if they act on their attraction to children. They do not choose to be pedophiles so I believe that they do not deserve to be attacked or viewed as a threat for simply existing.

People who are anti-abortion see abortions as killing a baby (or at the very least, killing a potential life) - and let's be honest, they might be completely, utterly wrong. However, that's their beliefs, and it's an impossible thing to quantify, so they also might be right.
